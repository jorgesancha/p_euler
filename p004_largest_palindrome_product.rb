# A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
# The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# Potential Improvements
# - Probably calculating all_palindromes in a range is overkill. Would be more efficient to find the candidates one by one from the top
# - Probably no need to go from 999 down_to 100 everytime - it should stop once it sees no two factors of 3 digits will do
